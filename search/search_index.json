This level of integration transforms the platform from a standalone tool into a seamless extension of existing contact center infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"projects/project-4/#technical-highlights","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Technical Highlights","text":""},{"location":"projects/project-4/#architecture-stack","title":"Architecture &amp; Stack","text":"<ul> <li>Backend: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.9+, Express.js microservices</li> <li>Frontend: React 18+ with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, drag-and-drop file handling</li> <li>Database: PostgreSQL 15+ with Row-Level Security for tenant isolation</li> <li>Cache/Queue: Redis 7+ for session management and message queuing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/project-4/#production-infrastructure","title":"Production &amp; Infrastructure","text":"<ul> <li>Containerization: Docker multi-stage builds with Kubernetes orchestration</li> <li>Cloud Agnostic: Helm charts supporting AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises deployment</li> <li>Monitoring: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, OpenTelemetry distributed tracing</li> <li>Security: End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+, AES-256), customer-managed keys via KMS</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/project-4/#developer-experience","title":"Developer Experience","text":"<ul> <li>Code Quality: ESLint with TypeScript rules, Prettier formatting, strict type checking</li> <li>Testing: Jest unit/integration tests, Playwright E2E, comprehensive security testing</li> <li>Documentation: OpenAPI specs, automated API documentation, operational runbooks</li> <li>Local Development: Native Node.js services with script-based lifecycle management</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/project-4/#key-metrics","title":"\ud83d\udcca Key Metrics","text":"<ul> <li>Processing Throughput: 5+ audio hours per minute per node</li> <li>Search Performance: Sub-1.5s latency for 100k+ conversations</li> <li>Test Coverage: 85%+ across all services with security validation</li> <li>Uptime Target: 99.9% SLA with automated failover and blue-green deployments</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/project-4/#development-process","title":"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Development Process","text":"<p>The platform follows modern DevOps practices with automated CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive testing suites, and production-ready monitoring.
