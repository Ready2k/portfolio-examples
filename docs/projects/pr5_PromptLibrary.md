## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### Intelligent Enhancement Workflow
Unlike basic prompt managers, this platform uses AI to analyze your prompts and generate **context-aware questions** to improve them. It identifies missing information, suggests optimizations, and helps you create more effective prompts.

### Provider-Agnostic Design
Write once, render everywhere. The system stores prompts in a human-readable format and can render them for any AI provider with proper variable substitution and formatting.

### Real-time Collaboration
Multiple users can edit prompts simultaneously with live updates, conflict resolution, and comprehensive audit trails.

### Enterprise-Grade Security
- Zero npm security vulnerabilities
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
