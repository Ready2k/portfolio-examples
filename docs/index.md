# 🧠 Introduction

Welcome — this is a **living showcase** of the projects I’ve been building lately....

To be brutally honest, every single one of these projects was **coded by AI**.  
I’ve been experimenting with tools like **Kiro.dev**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Claude Code**, and **Google Gemini** — but mostly **Kiro**.

The last time I personally wrote code was back in the 1990s...  
and let’s be real — nobody’s hiring for **Turbo Pascal** anymore.

## 🧪 The Experiment

When **Kiro** launched in Preview (June 2025), I was lucky enough to get early access.  
Since then, I’ve been running a series of small, two-to-three-week **micro-hackathons**, exploring what’s possible when you combine:
- 🧩 **AI-generated code**
- 🧠 **Some level of Human architectural thinking**
- 🧾 **Spec-driven development**
- 🎛️ **Rapid iteration and design feedback**

These projects represent that ongoing journey — blending AI’s speed with human intent.
They are not production ready or final versions, more like prototypes that might be of interest.

Most of the content, like this doucmentation and the demostrations have most been done vai AI.
